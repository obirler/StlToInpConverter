# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - 'All new business logic should have corresponding unit tests.'
  - "Refactor large functions to be more modular."
  - "Add docstrings to all functions and file headers."
  - "If any code file is added or removed, don't forget to update StlToInpConverter.csproj file accordingly."

# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.
branch: 'master'

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.

description: 'This project is a .Net Framework Console application written in C#'

# This sets whether to create pull requests as drafts. If this is set to True, then all pull requests will be created as drafts and GitHub Actions will not be triggered.
